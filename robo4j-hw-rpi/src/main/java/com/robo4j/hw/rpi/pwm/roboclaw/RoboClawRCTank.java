/**
 * A RoboClaw engine controller, controlled with a standard servo PWM signal.
 * Note that this is not the class to use if you want to control the RoboClaw
 * over USB. This class will only work with the RoboClaw in RC-mode, and a PWM
 * controller sending RC servo style signals (20 ms pulse period, 1.5 ms high
 * centered). It assumes mixing is not enabled.
 * 
 * Note that this class is not thread safe. If changes can be initiated from
 * different threads, the instance must be protected.
